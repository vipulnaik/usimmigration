This repository will contain historical data related to United States immigration statistics.

There is no public website as of now for accessing the data.

Sources I intend to use to access the data:

* [Visa Statistics](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/statistics.html)
* [Immigrant Visa Statistics](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/statistics/immigrant-visas.html)
* [Nonimmigrant Visa Statistics](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/statistics/non-immigrant-visas.html)
